### Hi there 👋

My name is Guilherme Cavalheiro!

## 🔭 Work

I work in HP, as a software engineering. Previously I was a HP intern in data science. Before HP, I was a research intern at a NLP Group in PUCRS, the college which I'm graduating.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I study ReactJS and Node to perform work related tasks, and in my spare time at work and life I dedicate myself to learn data engineering, which is the branch of data science that I want to focus my career in the next years.
